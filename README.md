# Elevator-Game

Welcome to CheckIn! This is a java consolew game, where the object of the game is to use the two provided elevators to 
transport each guest to their desired floor.
        
By default, the building will have 10 floors above ground and 10 floors below. The only floor that these two elevators 
meet is at floor 0, where one goes to above-ground, and the other goes to below-ground.
        
Keep in mind that each elevator has a specified max capacity and weight. Once a person reaches their desired floor, 
they may be checked out. The game can only be won when each person is checked out of the building.
        
There is a timer, so the aim is to complete this as fast as possible!
